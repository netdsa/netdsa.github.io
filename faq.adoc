== Why `dsatest`?

The main reason behind dsatest is to provide an API to write network test cases and control your bench.
The project provides an abstraction for links which allows anyone to contribute generic configuration files for switch chips and target platforms.
Only the bench configuration file describing how your target device is connected to your host is specific to your setup.
